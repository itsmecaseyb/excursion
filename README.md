#Excursion Web Page

##Description

This project is a web page created to advertise a new app called 
Excursion. This was created as a part of the Codecademy course on Git and 
GitHub.

**NOTE:** All HTML and CSS code is solution code provided by Codecademy, 
and not my original code. I used the solution code as my main focus with 
this project was learning how to use GitHub Pages, so I used source code 
to focus solely on using Git and GitHub.

##How To Use

Go to [this URL](https://itsmecaseyb.github.io/excursion/) to view the 
finished page.
